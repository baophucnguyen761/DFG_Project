**Data Flow Generator Project** - Language Java
-----------------------------------------------------------------
**Needs Statement**
**Purpose**
This document provides the functional need statements for the Data Flow Generator project. The Data Flow Generator system must allow users to automatically generate data flow diagrams (DFDs) from source code written in Java. The primary goal of this project is to generate visual representations of data flow in Java applications, which will aid developers in understanding the movement of data between various components of a codebase. The system will track inputs, outputs, and data transformations, providing critical insights for refactoring and optimizing code.

**The Data Flow Generator Functional Need Statement**
The Data Flow Generator is a software tool designed to help programmers analyze and visualize the movement of data through their Java programs.
Â·         In this document all mention of D.F.G. is the data flow generator.
1.      Data Flow Generator Functions:
1.1 Analyze code for the input data.
1.2 Track all occurrences of input data being call, set, or output of the code.
1.3 Display flow of inputted data.

**2. Secondary functions of D.F.G**
2.1 Stored previous project that the user may have run through the D.F.G.
2.2 Load and review previous data flow analysis.
2.3 The system will let users view data flow results as either a text report or a chart.
